# ChemModule - Python Module for Chemists

ChemModule is a complex Python module designed to provide chemists with various functionalities for chemical calculations and data analysis. It offers a wide range of methods for tasks such as calculating molar mass, molarity, concentration, volume, number of particles, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, pH, and hydrogen concentration.

## Installation

To use ChemModule, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install ChemModule using pip:

```shell
pip install chemmodule
```

## Usage

Import the `ChemModule` class from the module and create an instance:

```python
from chemmodule import ChemModule

chem = ChemModule()
```

### Calculating Molar Mass

You can calculate the molar mass of a chemical formula using the `calculate_molar_mass` method:

```python
formula = "H2O"
molar_mass = chem.calculate_molar_mass(formula)
print(f"The molar mass of {formula} is {molar_mass:.2f} g/mol")
```

### Calculating Molarity

You can calculate the molarity of a solution using the `calculate_molarity` method:

```python
concentration = 0.5  # in mol/L
volume = 1.0  # in L
molarity = chem.calculate_molarity(concentration, volume)
print(f"The molarity of the solution is {molarity:.2f} M")
```

### Calculating Concentration

You can calculate the concentration of a solution using the `calculate_concentration` method:

```python
molarity = 0.5  # in M
volume = 1.0  # in L
concentration = chem.calculate_concentration(molarity, volume)
print(f"The concentration of the solution is {concentration:.2f} mol/L")
```

### Calculating Volume

You can calculate the volume of a solution using the `calculate_volume` method:

```python
concentration = 0.5  # in mol/L
molarity = 1.0  # in M
volume = chem.calculate_volume(concentration, molarity)
print(f"The volume of the solution is {volume:.2f} L")
```

### Calculating Number of Particles

You can calculate the number of particles (atoms or molecules) using the `calculate_number_of_particles` method:

```python
moles = 2.5
num_particles = chem.calculate_number_of_particles(moles)
print(f"The number of particles is {num_particles:.2e}")
```

### Calculating Boiling Point Elevation

You can calculate the boiling point elevation of a solution using the `calculate_boiling_point_elevation` method:

```python
molality = 2.0  # in mol/kg
constant = 0.5  # in K/mol
boiling_elevation = chem.calculate_boiling_point_elevation(molality, constant)
print(f"The boiling point elevation is {boiling_elevation:.2f} K")
```

### Calculating Freezing Point Depression

You can calculate the freezing point depression of a solution using the `calculate_freezing_point_depression` method:

```python
molality = 2.0  # in mol/kg
constant = 1.5  # in K/mol
freezing_depression = chem.calculate_freezing_point_depression(molality, constant)
print(f"The freezing point depression is {freezing_depression:.2f} K")
```

### Calculating pH and Hydrogen Concentration

You can calculate the pH and hydrogen concentration of a solution using the

 `calculate_pH` and `calculate_hydrogen_concentration` methods:

```python
hydrogen_concentration = 1.0e-4  # in mol/L
pH = chem.calculate_pH(hydrogen_concentration)
print(f"The pH of the solution is {pH:.2f}")

pH = 3.5
hydrogen_concentration = chem.calculate_hydrogen_concentration(pH)
print(f"The hydrogen concentration is {hydrogen_concentration:.2e} mol/L")
```

## Customization

The `ChemModule` class can be customized and expanded based on your specific needs as a chemist. You can add new methods or modify existing ones to suit your requirements.
